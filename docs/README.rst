HiPerWalk
=========
**HiPerWalk** (High-Performance Quantum Walk Simulator) is a freeware open-source program that
allows the user to perform simulations of quantum walks on graphs using HPC.
The user can use the parallel resources of the computer,
such as accelerator cards, multicore CPU and GPGPU to
speedup the overall process without knowing parallel programming.
It is under development and employs C, Python and OpenCL.
