Development
===========

The ``main`` branch is where the new features are developed.
To contribute, clone the repository.

.. code-block:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/hiperwalk/hiperwalk.git

Then, make the desired alterations.
And make a pull request.

Documentation
-------------

It is very likely that there are new features in the ``main`` branch.
These new features are not documentated online.
To generate the current (under development) documentation locally,
install all the requirements (``docs/requirements.txt``),
then execute

.. code-block:: shell

   cd docs
   ./go
